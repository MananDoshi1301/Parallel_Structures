# Parallel Data Structures

This repository contains code, compilation intructions and in some cases observations to parallel data structures and algorithms developed by me.

### Following are the algorithms to refer:
1. Merge Sort and Bucket Sort using locks, barriers in pthreads (merge_lock)
2. Merge Sort and Quick Sort (Two variations) using OpenMP
