# Parallel Data Structures

This repository contains code, compilation intructions and in some cases observations to parallel data structures and algorithms developed by me.

### Following are the algorithms to refer:
1. Merge Sort and Bucket Sort using locks, barriers in pthreads (merge_lock)
2. Merge Sort and Quick Sort (Two variations) using OpenMP
3. Custom Concurreny Primitives (Without using Pthread mutexes)
    * Test-and-set lock
    * Test-and-test-and-set lock
    * Ticket lock
    * MCS Lock (grads only)
    * Sense reversal barrier
